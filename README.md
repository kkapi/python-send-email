# A simple script sending a message to mail using Python

## Reason for creation

In connection with the pandemic, I had distance physical education classes at the university. I had to send a report in strict form to the teacher every week for three months. This script was written in order not to waste time on the designing and sending of the report.

## Attention

Before running the script, —Åhange the emails and password in the script and unblock access to mail to untrusted applications using the following link:
